# NoteSensei

A note taking app for easy note organizing and thought capturing, with an aesthetic design (hopefully in the future). It's mainly gonna be a project for me to keep my skills up to date and try out new technoligies and ways of working.

## Features I want to include
- Markdown/rich text support
- Organizing in folders and sub folders
- emoji support would be cool
- async saving while creating or editing note so it doesnt get lost
- Authentication
- public sharing of note's (via url)
- Security ( Route protection, request validation, ...)

## Rules for myself

- Write clean code ( refractor day every now and then )
- Comment a lot to check & retain my knowledge

## Todolist

1. Refractor (scss to css)
2. Able to create subfolders
3. Able to create notes in folder
