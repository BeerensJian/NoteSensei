# NoteSensei

Is an app for organising knowledge or taking quick notes and todo's. The project is currently in it's infancy stages and I'm mainly focusing on adding functionality while not paying too much attention in making everything look nice (I'm sorry for your eyes in advance) but don't worry, I will start improving the design when I feel like enough functionality is has been added.

## Features I want to include
- Markdown/rich text support
- Organizing in folders and sub folders
- emoji support would be cool
- async saving while creating or editing note so it doesnt get lost
- Authentication
- public sharing of note's (via url)
- Security ( Route protection, request validation, ...)

## Rules for myself

- Write clean code ( refractor day every now and then )
- Comment a lot to check & retain my knowledge
